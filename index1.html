    <h2>RFID Door lock Access Control System</h2>
    <img src="https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RFID-based-Door-Lock-System.jpg" alt="RFID" width="300"<br>
    <p><strong>RFID Door Lock Access Control System is a security-based project designed to control door access using RFID technology.
    It allows only authorized users to enter by scanning their RFID card or tag.
    When a valid RFID card is detected, the system unlocks the door automatically.
    If an unauthorized card is scanned, access is denied and an alert can be triggered.
    The system is built using a microcontroller, RFID reader, and electronic door lock mechanism.
    It enhances security in homes, offices, and restricted areas.
    This project demonstrates the practical use of embedded systems and IoT-based security solutions.</strong></p>

    <p>An in-built restaurant menu and booking system is a digital, self-service, or staff-managed platform integrated directly into a website or POS,
     allowing 24/7 table reservations and advanced, or pre-order, menu ordering. These systems enable restaurants to manage 
     table inventory in real-time, reduce no-shows with deposit features, and capture guest data to boost sales. </p>
